# Unity-Tool-Audio-Preview
This is an example script for a tool in Unity to preview sound clips in-inspector.

The example script uses Reflection to hook into the Unity Editor's Audio method and play a clip from the inspector. An example use case of this would be configuring voiceover packs in the editor and the user/designer would need to quickly preview the clip without going into the Asset tree.
